# Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. Their financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wanted to modernize their operations by using the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). Artemis sought my expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats. As part of the team, I examined Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities. I also documented the results of a vulnerability assessment report that will be used for mitigating the security vulnerabilities that we discovered.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Secure coding is an essential aspect of software development. The security of a company's software should be a top priority, since companies stake their reputation on the security they offer to their customers. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

This project was a great opportunity to familiarize myself with vulnerability assessments overall, as well as being introduced to the National Vulnerability Database. This database helped me identify crucial security vulnerabilities, and address them in a project setting.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

This project used Maven, a commonly used software dependency checking tool. This tool helped me find security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's codebase, as well as recommending updates to critical sections of Artemis' tech stack. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Thankfully, Maven allows for continuous dependency checking, so even after updates were made, Maven could check for additional dependencies, which may introduce new security risks.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Maven was definitely a great asset for this project. It assisted with hardening the security of Artemis applications, as well as allowing me to make recommendations for updates for other projects moving forward.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I will likely show employers my ability to create, and make recommendations from, the results of software vulnerability reports.
