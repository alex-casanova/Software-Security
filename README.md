# Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    
    Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. Their financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wanted to modernize their operations by using the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). Artemis sought my expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats. As part of the team, I examined Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities. I also documented the results of a vulnerability assessment report that will be used for mitigating the security vulnerabilities that we discovered.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
